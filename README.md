# Digital-Birthday-Cake
I made myself a cake for my birthday. but this birthdaycake is digital. :)
I used the picobricks development board for this.
Picobricks has ssd1306 oled screen on it.
This card is programmable with microbloks. 
Firstly i drew a cake on the screen.
Later i used sound sensor. I tested the analog values that come when blown on the sensor.
If I blow on the sensor, the flame of the candles on the cake disappears from the screen.
like a real birthday cake...
Don't forget to make a wish :)
